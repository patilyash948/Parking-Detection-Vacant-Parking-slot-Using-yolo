# ðŸš— Parking Detection â€” Vacant Parking Slot Using YOLO

This repository implements a **parking-slot occupancy detection system** using **YOLO (Ultralytics)**.  
The system detects vehicles in a frame and checks if they overlap with predefined parking-slot regions to classify each slot as **Occupied** or **Vacant**.
